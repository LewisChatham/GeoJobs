# GeoJobs

## Vision
At GeoJobs our aim is to connect our users to job opportunities, providing a wealth of data from Adzuna's trusted job databases. We aim to make the job searching process as interactive as it can be, giving the user the tools they need to find their dream job.

## Description
The motivation for building this project was that many current job search platforms do not show a visual representation of the location that has been searched for. A map is built into the GeoJobs UI so that users can see the location that they have searched for, and the jobs are displayed in easy-to-read cards with a large number of options to filter and refine search.
